		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Ciro = Since the dawn of sentient life, this source of light and heat has been well known. The earliest wise ones called it King. We just call it Ciro, but surprise... Ciro = King!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Icarus = The likes of a spherical oyster or other mollusk is found in the sky. Mmm, oysters... Oh, wait, we're looking for planets. Let's name it Icarus!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Thalia = Holy-- what in the kraken?! It's horrible! It's terrifying!!! The obeservatory team evacuates. Thalia winks in satifaction.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Eta = A twinkling white glimmer emerges from behind the big, scary red glimmer. Eta, the fairest moon of all graces the archives.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Niven = Something about that big bright orange inspires sweets. The observatory team bets it will be sweet to go there. Pack extra ice, guys! We're going to Niven!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Gael = A motherly blue planet. Despite which, the anicients gave it a mainly male name. Well whatever, this planet is surprisignly solid on one side and liquid on the other. Go figure.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Iota = What's this? Is it a ball of sugar frost? Dried kokonut jelly rolled up and set into a place in orbit? The truth shall be revealed-- and sampled ASAP!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Ceti = Hey, another moon! But this one doesn't look like it aged well. It's probably fermenting. Let's at least give it a name so we can point it out. How about Ceti?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Tellumo = Intensity has never intensified like it does right now. With the tiniest of zoom-in, Tellumo's image becomes crystal clear.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Lili = You find a little sparkle racing around Tellumo, otherwise hiding well in its rings... Is this thing drunk on sugar?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Gratian = Looks like we found a giant peach, said James B. Gaelan.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Geminus = A white light begins to change direction and move the opposite way, towards a peach colored one. It must be a real gem of a moon; Hello, Geminus!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Otho = After watching for a solid few minutes the observatory team's gaze catches the giant. And the team panicks...apparently the giant's gaze has caught them!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Augustus = An orange light steals the show. It's confirmed to have a thick atmosphere. Space tourism just went to the next, next level.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Hephaestus = Woah. This moon is really small. We didn't expect to find it, honestly but we're glad it is where it is. Now, where's the trail mix?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Jannah = You see Jannah. But she sees you too and proceeds to flee behind Otho. Is it worth it to chase this moon?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Gauss = Behind a strong blue light further ahead, the team discovers...another gas giant? Other instruments promptly lock onto the presence of an enormous magnetic field. There's so much of it that a team member names the giant for it. We have ourselves a giant named Gauss.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Catullus = There's a big purple thing out there... Yes, purple! "Catullus," said Jade J Gaelan, a lead scientist who happens by as this discovery occurs. It's as if he was waiting for this moment.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Loki = "Trololol~Lo'lo'lololo~" Loki sings manically as he dances clear into view and into everyone's memories. For better or for worse.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Tarsiss = When you see a little dot circling a big dot of the same color you know it's something. And Tarsiss is that something.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Nero = The optics confirm a gas giant in the most vast of distances. No words are found to describe it. Nero the great, and his wide, inclined rings cause everyone to drop their jaw or sink to their knees.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Hadrian = Sensors detect what appears to be a strawberry with whipped cream on top. We elect to name it Hadrian, just in case it is not.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Narisse = The one scientist on duty at the time returns from obtaining caramel chocolate snacks. Somehow he spots the tiny Narisse, who looks just like those snacks.... Whoa.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Muse = Now, this is the most intriguing thing we've ever found. Look at those deltas! The observatory team finds itself musing for an excessive amount of time over it. Therefore, a poetically inclined Gaelean decides to name it Muse.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Minona = Ooooh. Pretty moon. Do you think it's Nero's wife or his daughter. Let's ask her. Minona! Hey, Minona!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Agrippina = The telescope locks on to a very suspicious moon. It's very small, it's very green, and probably full of ice... A passing Gaelean suggests a name starting with M, but it is swiftly declined as there are already two of those. It's named Agrippina instead.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Julia = Amidst the twinkling glimmers in this portion of the sky, one appears to fade very smoothly and even disappear. For reasons not yet revealed the name Julia is nominated for it. The name seems oddly motherly...
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Hox = You find a pale orange entity near the edge of the telescope's ES range. Is it the farthest one? Who knows. But you do know that its probably an ice planet. Planet Hox.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Argo = After studying for enough time, that one twinkle moving like the electron in a Hydrogen atom, you finally spot the siren, Argo.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Leto = Hold up. Is that an ice cream scoop in space??? Oh, it's Leto! But Leto's so far away! Maybe it's indeed an ice cream scoop. Maybe it has sprinkles?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Grannus = The Gaelean Historians have record of a red light called Grannus, that opened wide at us nearly 2000 years ago and then retreated. They could do with a less lofty vocabulary... But maybe they were talking about this star here.

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Ciro = Since the dawn of sentient life, this source of light and heat has been well known. The earliest wise ones called it King. We just call it Ciro, but surprise... Ciro = King!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Icarus = The likes of a spherical oyster or other mollusk is found in the sky. Mmm, oysters... Oh, wait, we're looking for planets. Let's name it Icarus!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Thalia = Holy-- what in the kraken?! It's horrible! It's terrifying!!! The obeservatory team evacuates. Thalia winks in satifaction.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Eta = A twinkling white glimmer emerges from behind the big, scary red glimmer. Eta, the fairest moon of all graces the archives.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Niven = Something about that big bright orange inspires sweets. The observatory team bets it will be sweet to go there. Pack extra ice, guys! We're going to Niven!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Gael = A motherly blue planet. Despite which, the anicients gave it a mainly male name. Well whatever, this planet is surprisignly solid on one side and liquid on the other. Go figure.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Iota = What's this? Is it a ball of sugar frost? Dried kokonut jelly rolled up and set into a place in orbit? The truth shall be revealed-- and sampled ASAP!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Ceti = Hey, another moon! But this one doesn't look like it aged well. It's probably fermenting. Let's at least give it a name so we can point it out. How about Ceti?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Tellumo = Intensity has never intensified like it does right now. With the tiniest of zoom-in, Tellumo's image becomes crystal clear.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Lili = You find a little sparkle racing around Tellumo, otherwise hiding well in its rings... Is this thing drunk on sugar?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Gratian = Looks like we found a giant peach, said James B. Gaelan.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Geminus = A white light begins to change direction and move the opposite way, towards a peach colored one. It must be a real gem of a moon; Hello, Geminus!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Otho = After watching for a solid few minutes the observatory team's gaze catches the giant. And the team panicks...apparently the giant's gaze has caught them!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Augustus = An orange light steals the show. It's confirmed to have a thick atmosphere. Space tourism just went to the next, next level.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Hephaestus = Woah. This moon is really small. We didn't expect to find it, honestly but we're glad it is where it is. Now, where's the trail mix?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Jannah = You see Jannah. But she sees you too and proceeds to flee behind Otho. Is it worth it to chase this moon?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Gauss = Behind a strong blue light further ahead, the team discovers...another gas giant? Other instruments promptly lock onto the presence of an enormous magnetic field. There's so much of it that a team member names the giant for it. We have ourselves a giant named Gauss.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Catullus = There's a big purple thing out there... Yes, purple! "Catullus," said Jade J Gaelan, a lead scientist who happens by as this discovery occurs. It's as if he was waiting for this moment.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Loki = "Trololol~Lo'lo'lololo~" Loki sings manically as he dances clear into view and into everyone's memories. For better or for worse.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Tarsiss = When you see a little dot circling a big dot of the same color you know it's something. And Tarsiss is that something.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Nero = The optics confirm a gas giant in the most vast of distances. No words are found to describe it. Nero the great, and his wide, inclined rings cause everyone to drop their jaw or sink to their knees.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Hadrian = Sensors detect what appears to be a strawberry with whipped cream on top. We elect to name it Hadrian, just in case it is not.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Narisse = The one scientist on duty at the time returns from obtaining caramel chocolate snacks. Somehow he spots the tiny Narisse, who looks just like those snacks.... Whoa.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Muse = Now, this is the most intriguing thing we've ever found. Look at those deltas! The observatory team finds itself musing for an excessive amount of time over it. Therefore, a poetically inclined Gaelean decides to name it Muse.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Minona = Ooooh. Pretty moon. Do you think it's Nero's wife or his daughter. Let's ask her. Minona! Hey, Minona!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Agrippina = The telescope locks on to a very suspicious moon. It's very small, it's very green, and probably full of ice... A passing Gaelean suggests a name starting with M, but it is swiftly declined as there are already two of those. It's named Agrippina instead.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Julia = Amidst the twinkling glimmers in this portion of the sky, one appears to fade very smoothly and even disappear. For reasons not yet revealed the name Julia is nominated for it. The name seems oddly motherly...
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Hox = You find a pale orange entity near the edge of the telescope's ES range. Is it the farthest one? Who knows. But you do know that its probably an ice planet. Planet Hox.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Argo = After studying for enough time, that one twinkle moving like the electron in a Hydrogen atom, you finally spot the siren, Argo.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Leto = Hold up. Is that an ice cream scoop in space??? Oh, it's Leto! But Leto's so far away! Maybe it's indeed an ice cream scoop. Maybe it has sprinkles?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Grannus = The Gaelean Historians have record of a red light called Grannus, that opened wide at us nearly 2000 years ago and then retreated. They could do with a less lofty vocabulary... But maybe they were talking about this star here.
